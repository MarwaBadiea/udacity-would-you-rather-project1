This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Project Overview

In the "Would You Rather?" Game, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather option A or option B ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

How to Run:

- Download or clone this repository.
- Install all project dependencies with npm install.
- Start the development server with npm start.
- App can be seen at: http://localhost:3000.
- The page will reload if you make edits.

For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

- src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.
